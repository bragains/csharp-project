Basic website for Kimberley Mining LLC. To use application function, click on REGISTER, complete form, and hit ADD USER. You are directed to page that says you've successfully added new user and provided a button to view all users. In the User list, you can edit users and delete users.

This will eventually be a live website with a client portal and an admin portal. The admin portal will serve as the domain for adding, and deleting users. The goal is to create a client dashboard eventually for investers to see their stats and update their user information.
